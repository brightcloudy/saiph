TODO list for rawrmage
 - Shopping! - far goal
 - Why is there an armor drop and pickup loop between Burdened and Stressed?
 X You can't take off your gloves when a weapon is welded to your hand.
 - Various loops with nymphs - why?
   - From what I've observed it looks like we want to move away from nymphs,
     but we instantly forget this and move back, causing oscillation.
 X We can't kick with wounded legs - thought we'd already fixed this, but
   this was observed in Sokoban.
   - fixed, we didn't make the necessary check
 X We can't kick when stressed or above, either...
 X Make saiph understand "You can't open anything -- you have no hands!" (attempt open a door in a polyform without hands (e.g. werefoo))
 X Make saiph understand "You cannot wear a shield while wielding a two-handed weapon."
 ? Make saiph understand "The very idea of praying to a lawful god is repugnant to you."
 - Adopt a more "defensive" combat strategy.
 - Are we walking into vault teleporters? Why?
 ? Don't go up stairs when stressed, don't try.
 - Saiph desperately needs to manage inventory better as a whole.
   - She currently likes to hoard tons of stuff and not want to get rid of it.
     Perhaps this is because we have "I want to pick this up to evaluate it"
     acting the same as "I don't want to drop this." Code is there to 
     differentiate between the two in Armor, at least, but we shouldn't have 
     to explicitly add that to every analyzer. An event which is the 
     counterpart of WantItems for asking an analyzer "What are you willing to
     get rid of?" and changing the behavior of wantItems to only govern
     pickup is one way of limiting this.
   - To determine what an Analyzer is willing to drop we need to have more 
     precise weight management, as well as some sort of algorithm for every
     analyzer to score items.
   - (yes, I know this has been discussed to death already. sorry for keeping
     on this.)
 - Documentation:
     - A "Guide to Saiph" would be nice
	- How does she work? What are Analyzers, Actions, Events?
	- Where are good places to look to familiarize yourself?
     - Formalize TODOs in LP bug reports/blueprints
     - Go through files and attempt to comment
